for font tags. See long explanations in the code for the rationale.\n\nThis results in various FATE changes which I'll explain here:\n\n- various swapping in font attributes, this is mostly noise due to the\n  old reverse stack way of printing them. The new one is more correct as\n  the last attribute takes over the previous ones.\n\n- unrecognized tags disappears\n\n- invalid tags that were previously displayed aren't anymore (instead,\n  we have a warning). This is better for the end user\n\nThe main benefit of this commit is to be more tolerant to error, leading\nto a better handling of badly nested tags or random wrong formatting for\nthe end user.","insertions":92,"deletions":159,"filepaths":{"libavcodec/htmlsubtitles.c":{"insertions":67,"deletions":134},"tests/ref/fate/sub-sami2":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"tests/ref/fate/sub-srt":{"insertions":7,"deletions":7},"tests/ref/fate/sub-srt-badsyntax":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"tests/ref/fate/sub-textenc":{"insertions":7,"deletions":7},"tests/ref/fate/sub-webvttenc":{"insertions":7,"deletions":7}}},"50332f8a6bc303b6147fe34a481a2c0b80ac12be":{"author":"Yayoi","email":"yayoi.ukai@gmail.com","date":"2015-08-30 14:24:47 UTC","message":"avcodec/srtdec: factor out HTML parsing code\n\nThis code will be used in SAMI decoder in a later commit.\n\nSigned-off-by: Clément Bœsch <u@pkh.me>","insertions":148,"deletions":208,"filepaths":{"libavcodec/Makefile":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"libavcodec/htmlsubtitles.c":{"insertions":0,"deletions":176},"libavcodec/htmlsubtitles.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":29},"libavcodec/srtdec.c":{"insertions":147,"deletions":2}}},"894995c41e0795c7a44f81adc4838dedc3932e65":{"author":"Kevin Backhouse via RT","email":"security-reports@semmle.com","date":"2019-02-06 12:56:01 UTC","message":"avcodec/htmlsubtitles: Fixes denial of service due to use of sscanf in inner loop for handling braces\n\nFixes: [Semmle Security Reports #19439]\nFixes: dos_sscanf2.mkv\n\nSigned-off-by: Michael Niedermayer <michael@niedermayer.cc>","insertions":2,"deletions":21,"filepaths":{"libavcodec/htmlsubtitles.c":{"insertions":2,"deletions":21}}}}
